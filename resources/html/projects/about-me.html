  You looking at it! This is my third attempt at creating a portfolio website.
  <ol>
    <li>
      <a ui-sref="project({title: 'Svn_portfolio'})">
        Svn_portfolio
      </a>
      was my first web application. Had some interesting connections to svn.
      Thats about it, I had no idea how to write html or javascript at the time.
    </li>
    <li>
      ??????? I tried again right after college and was discouraged, since I couldn't
      figure out how to host a website from my computer.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    A co-worker introduced me to vpns, witch offered me a cheap, easy way to
    host an application from my personal computer. At this point I prefer to
    have total control and easy access to my deployed projects. This makes
    development, testing and debugging much easier.
  </p>
  <p>
    A few interesting things about this application.
    <ol>
      <li>
        A
        <a target="_blank"
          href="https://github.com/jozsefmorrissey/aboutMe/blob/master/runWatch.sh">
          Bash
        </a>
        script, which monitors and repairs the vpn connection as well as
        restarting th server if it cannot connect.
      </li>
      <li>
        It uses
        <a target="_blank"
          href='https://github.com/jozsefmorrissey/aboutMe/blob/master/.eslintrc.json'>
          eslint
        </a>,
        its basically the AirBnb template rules only made a few
        modifications.
      </li>
      <li>
        Also is using
        <a target="_blank"
          href='https://github.com/jozsefmorrissey/aboutMe/blob/master/webpack.config.js'>
          Webpack and Bable
        </a>
        I really enjoy the way webpack links files. It makes modularizing easy
        and intuitive. Since I have not been in the Javascript game for that
        long, and do no know how much Bable is improving my life. Although I
        know IE does not support template literals. Thank god I can use them
        with Bable.
      </li>
