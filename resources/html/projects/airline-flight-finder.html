    This project was fun! Tying to visualize the traversal of a graph can push
    my mind to its limits. I will never forget this project. A negative aspect
    of my personality is that I don't follow instructions very well. When this
    assignment was due, before class my buddy asked me how I did with Dexter's
    algorithm... I did not know what that was.

    Turns out I created something similar to deal with slow processing times.
    I tend to figure things out for myself, it is time consuming upfront, but
    pays off in the end. If
    you are interested the section concerning my solution for a priority queue
    search algorithm. See

    <b>Disclaimer: </b> looking over my work sorting the explore list array would
    have made the solution even better.
