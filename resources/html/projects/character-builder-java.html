    <ul>
      <li>
        <b><u>SQL</u></b>
        <br>
        Here is a
        <a target="_blank"
          href="/resources/html/charBuildDBSchema.html">
          DB Schema</a>.
        <br>
        To view what I have written, check out this

          href='https://github.com/jozsefmorrissey/CharacterBuilderJava/tree/master/Setup%20files/DATA%20BASE'>
          directory</a>.
        The files are numbered since I bundle them using the following cmds:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Empty DB Setup:</b> cat OracleDB/*.sql > OracleDBSimpleSetup.sql
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Populated DB Setup</b> cat OracleDB/*.sql OracleDB/PopulateData/*.sql > OracleDBPopulateData.sql
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        The functions are worth looking into these are a few highlights:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>FUNCTION GET_ALL_LINKS -</b>
            I want to allow the users to identify people they claim are using
            multiple profiles. This function finds those links within the DB to
            avoid the need to transmit all the data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>CONCATINATE_DESCRIPTIONS -</b>
            This helps to avoid restricting the size of a description within the
            database while preventing large memory allocations to small bits of
            information. This function is generalized so that all three tables,
            event, user, and skill description, can have as long of a
            description as the Java will allow (it is restricted in

              charBuild.properties</a>)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        <b><u>Inheritance</u></b>
        <br>
        I went a little extreme with inheritance on this project. I know my
        current employer wouldn’t pay me to do this type of work. However, they
        would be smart to do so. By spending time mapping classes to each other,
        I have isolated and generalized the most complex aspects of this
        application, which means easy system-wide fixes and improved
        maintainability. Inheritance with spring entities and JPARepo's is not
        easy. I’ve since created a
        <a target="_blank"
          href='/resources/html/DescriptionInheritance.html'>
          Document
        </a>
        in which I can visualize my work
        and refer to it for future reference. The document links to some of the
        more complex examples, but with a quick glance, it’s clear the whole
        application relies heavily on inheritance.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        <b><u>JUnit</u></b>
        <br>
        Testing is great! JUnit is a powerful and easy to use framework. I know
        I can run my tests and verify that my application is working at any
        point. I’ve thoroughly tested the existing service layer with one or two
        exceptions. Some classes are still under construction. To check out the
        code click
        <a target="_blank"
          href='https://github.com/jozsefmorrissey/CharacterBuilderJava/tree/master/SpringBoot/src/test/java/com/characterBuilder/services'>
          here</a>.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        <b><u>SpringMVC</u></b>
        <br>
        Not much to say here MVC is EZ. You can look at my rest controllers
        <a target="_blank"
          href='https://github.com/jozsefmorrissey/CharacterBuilderJava/tree/master/SpringBoot/src/main/java/com/characterBuilder/controllers'>
          here</a>.
          I only have two done, but like I said, it's the easy part. After I
          finish JUnit testing all the services, I don’t expect to run into any
          issues with the controllers.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        <b><u>SpingAOP</u></b>
        <br>
        Again, not much to say about this framework, not because AOP is easy pre
        se, it's just difficult to find appropriate applications of the concept.
        Currently all I have implemented is logging. I’ve surrounded my
        controllers with an AOP class with the intent of conducting user
        authentication. I’m not sure how exactly it will work, but it will be
        clean and secure when done.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        <b><u>SpringBoot</u></b>
        <br>
        I love the Boot. It has spoiled me. I can't stand the complex
        configurations at work. I prefer a server that takes one or two very
        simple files.

    There are very complex ideas behind this project. So much so, that I have a
    hard time describing what I want to do and why I want to do it. That being
    said, I am well aware that if your idea isn’t concrete and simple, you have
    very little chance of your solution being useful to anyone. Let me explain...
  </p>
  <p>
    Games are addictive because they restrict your possible moves to a
    manageable number. Then you can better decide how to proceed. You are
    almost always moving forward and accomplishing missions, tasks, quests... My
    hope is to crowdsource, positive activities that you can do locally to
    improve yourself and those around you.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>
      Really I am trying to resolve the problem of waste. Wasting resources,
      money, time, and potential.
    </b>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Resources: </b> This is not a problem I wish to address
        directly. Only a fool would think they could create a plan to allocate
        another's resources effectively. To aid in the preservation of
        resources, I hope my application encourages the free market. Not only
        since effective resource allocation is an intrinsic property of the free
        market, but because it outsources the problem to millions, hopefully
        billions, of organic processors in the world.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        <b>Money: </b> Again, my idea is not to tackle this problem head on.
        Money and resources are one in the same. The best person to utilize
        either effectively is the earner/owner of the money/resource.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        <b>Time: </b> My worst enemy. As you can probably tell from my git repo,
        I have a lot of ideas (most of which will never amount to anything).
        Still, my time is used fairly productively. Instead of surfing Facebook,
        I’m solving problems and becoming smarter. I want the application to be
        an interface that easily shows users more productive activities located
        near to them. I’ll go into more detail below.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        <b>Potential: </b> This is very similar to time, since how we spend our
        time, dictates how well we achieve our full potential.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>
      Here are some of the features of my application that I hope will help
      achieve a more productive and happy society:
    </b>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Events: </b> An event or activity is anything you would like to do
        with other people. I don’t intend to restrict the types of events
        (Except for active calls to violence). However, people who live close to
        you will have the power to have your events removed. The intent of
        productive activities will be indicated. However, no known algorithm can
        possibly make this judgment call as well as the people around you. As
        long as you're not surrounded by criminals.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        <b>Radius: </b> "Radius of Concern" is a key feature. While advanced
        users will be able to have their radius encompass the entire world. You
        have to start with a small radius that encompasses no more than a couple
        neighbors. As you engage in "Events" and build skills and ratings, the
        distance of your radius can be increased. By limiting your scope to the
        people around you, it helps you engage with the individuals that can
        have the largest direct impact on your life. As you build skills, your
        ability to collaborate with others will improve and a larger network of
        people will become available to you.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        <b>Skills: </b> Skills can really be anything. I haven’t completely
        decided how this will be done, but my hope is to create a non-intrusive
        interface. I would like to build a skill hierarchy with crowd-sourced
        information. Allowing users to enter any skill, means we need to
        generalize them so it’s understandable and useful to others trying to
        assess the individual, while still maintaining valuable information. For
        instance, I’m an experienced programmer. Some people may only care about
        that fact. Others may need a Java Programmer. By having an inheritance
        tree, it would allow other users to view your skills at a resolution
        that is appropriate for their purposes.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        <b>Rating: </b> I wrote a few equations to understand how I might
        approach this. When you rate another user, if you possess an equivalent
        rating, the rating you assign will be weighted relative to the rating
        you possess. If you possess no rating your input will be counterweighted
        but still have some value. This is a chicken or the egg problem. Users
        without ratings have to be able to rate others or no-one would have any
        ratings. All ratings will be displayed relative to other users. The
        scope of users you are compared against will depend on your radius. I
        will probably use the [Link to and explanation: Pareto distribution],
        since it reflects reality so well and it should be easy to climb quickly
        at the beginning, but maxing out is next to impossible.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        <b>Reputation: </b> One of the most difficult parts of navigating
        through life, is that strangers have no concept of who you are. By
        recording the types of activities you have participated in and finding
        clever ways to summarize this information, it will be an asset for the
        individual as well as prospective employers, friends, or lovers... To
        make sure the data is summarized in a useful manner there needs to be an
        easy to use API so that third party companies can access and assess the
        available data, allowing them to find clever ways to interpret it for
        specific purposes.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        <b>One User: </b> Ideally, I would want a single person to only be able
        to create a single user. To avoid fraud there will be a series of checks
        in place to ensure that no user can receive too many skills or ratings
        in a short period of time (I still need to figure out the best way to
        accomplish this). Either way, having a long history combined with
        positive feedback is what good 'Characters' will possess. There’s no
        doubt that some people will play the long con, but the more difficult it
        is, the fewer the number of people who will be able to successfully pull
        it off.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        <b>Local Auditing: </b> The bottom up approach is the only way to truly
        build a strong society. Nearly all the power to regulate the users is in
        the hands of their local peers. The opinions of those with a higher
        rated character will hold more weight. However, as in real life, a
        critical mass of low rated characters will be able to overrule the
        dictator.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        <b>Crypto Currency: </b> This is a stretch goal and I’ll need to study
        law and consult with lawyers to figure out how to do it. I would like to
        give users an easy to use interface to make monetary exchanges, free of
        the peering eye of the government. I hope this doesn't turn you off, it
        goes back to point 1 & 2 above... No one is more capable of responsibly
        using the resources/money of another. The only area of government I
        support, albeit reluctantly, is national defense. The excessive wasteful
        spending of the military is a large factor contributing to my
        anti-government stance. National defense is important enough to overlook
        this human rights violation, for now. The rest of their activities are
        not.
        <br>
      </li>
      <br>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    I realize this concept may be overly optimistic and naive. In a time where a
    majority of the population prefers instant meaningless gratification over
    truly rewarding experiences. I would not be surprised if hardly anyone used
    the application. However, I do believe that if one or two places were able
    to use the application as intended, the people who lived there would be so
    much better off. Perhaps then their neighbors would start, and then their
    neighbors’ neighbors, and so on and so forth and it could spread like
    wildfire. There is too much untapped wealth every where in the world. We
    just have to release a little to show the world the route to prosperity.
