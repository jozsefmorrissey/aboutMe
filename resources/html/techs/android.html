    This is the only android project I have created. It was done after only one
    C programming class. It's definitely not bad for never having written Java,
    XML, or even Html. I would like to build more apps however, from what I
    hear google and others, are trying to develop frameworks that
    automatically format for different devices. If you are good with Bootstrap,
    this can already be done. With how easy cross browser development
    has become with angularJS is combined with Webpack. I am eager to try a
    framework that 'auto' Bootstraps for devices.
