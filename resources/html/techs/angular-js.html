    I really enjoy this framework. After dealing with PHP and JSP it is
    amazing to have a tool that so cleanly isolates code from html. By forcing
    developers to write services, to maintain data, really encourages
    modularization. I like using directives, recursive directives are challenging
    and can be very elegant solutions. I know they have been removed
    from other versions of Angular Iâ€™m curious to see how clean the html and controller
    are when they are behaving like a directive.
