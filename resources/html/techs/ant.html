    Ant builds are way better than make files. Most of what I have learned can
    be found in

      SqLazy</a>.
    Although they are far more valuable at work. When dealing with Webshere
    servers with complex configurations. The process to configure a workspace
    takes me atleast a full day, sometimes more. Using Ant I have automated one
    of the applications at work. So no-one ever has to deal with that crap again!
