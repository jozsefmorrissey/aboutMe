    Almost all my scripting work is on my work computer. Bash is by
    far my favorite scripting language (excluding Javascript) since almost everything I need is a linux
    command that I have already worked with. Although I do not care for
    conditionals I always struggle creating branch statements. I think the
    syntax is hard to read and easy to mess up.
