    As part of the C family, I cannot help but enjoy this language. I have only
    coded one project in C#. Based on what colleges have told me, the .Net
    framework puts Javas Spring to shame. If that's true, I need to switch. Not
    really, for now Spring is treating me well. Although, if I land a job using
    C# I will enthusiastically take on the .Net framework.
