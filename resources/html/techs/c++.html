    About a year ago I watched a couple hours of youtube videos, with the
    creator, Bjarne Stroustrup. He had an amazing vision that has withstood the
    test of time fairly well. If this language was as popular as Java or C# It
    would be the my prefered language. The concept alone, having the power of C
    in an object oriented language, is amazing. However, since it is not as
    popular, in my experience the libraries and community support are some what
    laking. That being said if someone wants to pay me, I will work in assembly
    code. Coding is coding and I like it all. For my personal projects, I need
    to use popular languages with good frameworks, or I would never get anything
    done.
