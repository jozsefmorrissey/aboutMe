    You never forget your first love. I can't say, that it was love at first sight.
    It was at least a week of boring powerpoints, before we got to fool around.
    Once I saw what programming had to offer, I was hooked. If you want, you can
    read the whole story,

      A Pleasurable Conquest</a>.
    To be honest after spending years dating easier languages. I have no doubt I
    will struggle at first to be chivalrous (manage memory), and obey (use
    pointers properly). With how quickly we hit it off the first time. I'm
    sure we can rekindle our love. All the other languages have
    shown me a world of instant gratification, but I know there is a deeper and
    more meaningful connection to be made with a goddess like C.
