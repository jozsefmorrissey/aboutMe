    Doxygen is a cool tool, I need to. Add Doxygen to my CharacterBuilder app.
    My knowledge is pretty basic. I have to look up the commands every time I
    use it. I would like to work on a project in a continuous integration
    environment, with a Doxygen script and SonarQube configured to ensure
    everyone adheres to commenting standards.
