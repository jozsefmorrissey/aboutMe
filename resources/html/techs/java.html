    Right now Java is my prefered backend programming language. The Spring
    Framework is very powerfull, getting you up and running in no time. Like
    most of the languages I have worked in, it has a C like syntax. Making it
    very easy for my abstract mind to apply the same concepts. Another perk of
    Java is JUnit. I have the most experience with this testing environment, I'll
    take unit testing over debugging old code. Which is inevitable without
    through testing.
