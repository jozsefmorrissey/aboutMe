    You probably do not know what javapoet is. It is a code generation library.
    I used on one application that read existing Java code and generated new
    code with a DAO design pattern. I really enjoyed this, writing code to
    generate code is challenging and powerful. I hope to work on frameworks at
    some point in my career.
