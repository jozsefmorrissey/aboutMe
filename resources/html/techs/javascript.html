    Javascript has been my salvation, in my current employment. My access to
    libraries and other development tools is so restricted, I have learned
    powershell, batch scripting, and bash scripting. Once I learned npm was not
    restricted, almost all my scripting is done with nodeJs. I have written more
    than 5000 lines of javascript to automate various aspects of my job. It's
    too bad I can't figure out a way to make a useful library out of it. Anyways
    Javascript is probably my second love. It feels almost as powerful as C
    and it's easier to write. Although I need a server side debugger and a
    good testing framework.
