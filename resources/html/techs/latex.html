    I like LaTex! Although, almost all of my work in it was for proof classes.
    I wouldn't mind leaning TeX at some point. A turing complete texted based language.
    The hardest class I took in college was about proving that mathematical proofs
    were valid. I didnâ€™t do well in it, but if I could write a program in Tex that validates
    proofs that would be awesome. Might be possible with TeX
