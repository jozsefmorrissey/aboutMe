    For the sort time I used this IDE there were no complaints. A few people I
    have met swear by the products from JetBrains. I should probably pay and
    find out for myself. Although I am using atom to create this application
    I only use IDE's to run servers and debug. I guess if my projects get large
    enough that Eclipse starts struggling I will switch.
