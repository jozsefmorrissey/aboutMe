    If C and Javascript are loves, then python is your best friend. Someone you
    can run off with have some fun without getting too serious. Wait... Is
    Javascript my true love... I don't know, that sentence describes Javascript
    too. Anyways, when I was in school Python was where I went to experiment.
    If I wasn't sure if something would work, throw something together in Python
    and run it. I never created anything too complex in python. I'm not sure
    how to link files and create classes. I would be fine working in this
    language, as long as all of our editors are tabbing properly.
