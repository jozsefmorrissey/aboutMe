    AOP is a cool concept. Knowing when and how to use it is difficult. The only
    original way I have thought of to use it, is in
    user Authentication. Since an application may have dozens or even hundreds
    of endpoints that need to be protected. An aop function would be much
    cleaner and more secure.
