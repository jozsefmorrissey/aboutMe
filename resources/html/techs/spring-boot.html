    Boot has spoiled me. It does exactly what it and all the other Spring Modules
    were designed to do. Get projects up and running quickly. I haven't leaned
    enough about servers and their configurations to know how an opinionated
    server will affect application performance. Why waste time worrying about
    that before you even know if the application is good enough to warrant server
    performance enhancements.
