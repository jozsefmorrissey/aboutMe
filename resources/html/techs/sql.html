    I really want to talk to someone who loves SQL. I like it, for joining,
    sorting, even modifying data, but its not easy for me. The language is not
    yet easy to read and write. That's why I would like to speak to someone who
    knows and loves it. Maybe they could clear up any misconceptions and
    describe the language in a way that I can digest.
