<div>
  <p>
    I wish we could replace all Html with Xml. I do not like the fact that some
    html tags have closing tags, some don't. It makes for inconsistent practices
    and my server side jQuery won't run on incorrect Html. I tried writing an
    html correcting tool but it was easier just to write my own parser. In a
    world where Xml replaced all html we wouldn't have this problem.
