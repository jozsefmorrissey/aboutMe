    <p>
      As you may have guessed the theme of this website is the relationship
      between chaos and order. I dont know of any aspect of reality that cannot
      be described as such, when viewed from the right angle. Over the past few
      years, I have come to realize that straddling the line between chaos and
      order is fundamentally, what life is all about.

  <b class='sub-title'>Taming the Chaos</b>
  <div class='indent'>
    <p>
      I think everyone enjoys bringing chaos to order, whether your organizing,
      fixing, or cleaning. It feels good to take something from an undesirable
      state to a desirable one. For me it’s almost like a junkie chasing a high.

      <b>Cleaning</b>
      <br>
      When I was very young I enjoyed cleaning. As I got better at cleaning, the
      size of the job had to get bigger and messier in order for me to feel
      fulfilled. I remember several occasions when I would stay up all night and
      clean the entire downstairs floor of my house. If I cleaned while everyone
      was awake somebody might help and that wouldn't feel as good as doing
      everything myself.

      <b>Math</b>
      Math was another passion when I was younger. It’s one of the few subjects
      in the world, maybe the only one, where the only chaos that exists is
      within your own mind. I find the concept of that soothing. I think I
      latched on to math, and later programming, to wrestle the chaos within my
      own mind.

      <b>Wood Working</b>
      <br>
      Woodworking will always be a passion of mine, although I enjoy the process
      of design far more than the process of constructing. Designing furniture
      is just creativity combined with applied mathematics. The chaos here is
      created by the needs, or desires, of people. How well your furniture turns
      out is a measurement of how well you were able to tame the chaos. Hopefully,
      later in life I, will be able to combine my programming knowledge with
      machines and automate many of the tedious aspects of our existence.

      <b>Programming</b>
      <br>
      Programming is the ideal activity for me to fully enjoy my love of design
      and perfection. If we ignore hardware failure, a program will do exactly
      as I tell it to do. Again, I prefer and enjoy certainty. Even hardware
      failure can be predicted and planned for, making an application nearly as
      concrete as mathematical logic, almost completely eliminating chaos from
      the equation (exp: solar flares, WWIII). A program is the essence of
      order, I cannot fathom the number of events that have to take place in
      order for you to see this webpage. Baring hardware failures and changes in
      supporting software, this app in its current state will always behave
      exactly the same way.
